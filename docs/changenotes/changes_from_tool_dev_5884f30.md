# Test Reorganization Changes from 5884f30

## Overview

This change reorganizes the test files related to tool functionality to improve code organization and maintainability. The main goal was to move core tool functionality tests from `test_llm` to `test_tools` directory, while keeping LLM integration tests in the appropriate location.

## Changes Made

1. **Created a new file in the `test_tools` directory**:
   - `tests/test_tools/test_tool_generation.py`: Contains all the core tool functionality tests, including:
     - Tests for `FunctionGuard` and `BasicFunctionGuard`
     - Tests for tool parameter generation from functions and Pydantic models
     - Tests for type conversions for tool parameters
     - Tests for custom guard implementations

2. **Created a new file in the `test_llm` directory**:
   - `tests/test_llm/test_tool_llm_integration.py`: Contains the LLM integration tests, including:
     - Tests for OpenAI tool integration
     - Tests for tool call response handling

3. **Removed the original file**:
   - Deleted `tests/test_llm/test_tool_generation.py` since its contents have been moved to the new files

## Benefits of Reorganization

This restructuring improves the organization of the codebase by:

1. **Logical organization**: Tests are now located in directories that match their functionality
2. **Code cohesion**: All tool-related tests are now in the same directory
3. **Separation of concerns**: LLM integration tests are kept separate from core tool functionality tests

## Test Coverage

The reorganization maintains full test coverage:

- All core tool functionality tests pass
- LLM integration tests are properly skipped when not using real tokens
- All 41 tests in the `test_tools` directory pass successfully
- The 2 integration tests in `test_llm/test_tool_llm_integration.py` are properly skipped when not using real tokens

## Verification

All tests were run and verified to be working correctly after the reorganization:

```bash
poetry run pytest tests/test_tools/ tests/test_llm/test_tool_llm_integration.py -v
```

Result: `41 passed, 2 skipped, 4 warnings`
